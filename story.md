  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p class="lead">We’re a family from Park City who turned weekend laps into a full-fuel chase of world stages.</p>

      <h2>Park City roots</h2>
      <p>From early-morning chairlifts to late-night wax rooms, the Macuga routine has always been about showing up together and getting better together.</p>

      <h2>Four kids, three disciplines</h2>
      <p>Alpine speed, moguls, and ski jumping—each path different, same stoke. Lauren, Alli, Sam, and Daniel push one another on and off snow.</p>

      <h2>Milano–Cortina 2026 and beyond</h2>
      <p>The dream is simple: keep progressing, keep showing up, and make people smile along the way.</p>
